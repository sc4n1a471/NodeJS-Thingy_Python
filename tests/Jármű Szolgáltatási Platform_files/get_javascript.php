/*
This is the original _sys_mask JavaScript code shipped with SNAP.
This code is empty by design.

DO NOT EDIT THIS JavaScript CODE!

If you want to customize your 'snap-mask' add-on block, create a new JavaScript
code and write your code there. Then set the ID of that JavaScript code in your
snap.ini in the [REPOSITORY] section after the _sys_mask= key.
